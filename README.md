# ConsoleGameEngine
Game Engine created entirely within Windows' console API. Inspired by javidx9's olcConsoleGameEngine (original: https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/videos/blob/master/olcConsoleGameEngine.h), written from scratch with my own modifications and improvements. Personal, non-commercial project.

The original olcConsoleGameEngine is placed under the GNU GPLv3 license (https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/videos/blob/master/LICENSE)
