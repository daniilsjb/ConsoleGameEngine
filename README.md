# ConsoleGameEngine
Game Engine created entirely within Windows' console API. Inspired by javidx9's olcConsoleGameEngine, written from scratch with my own modifications and improvements. Personal, non-commercial project.

Note: the engine is currently written as a single header file (just like the original olcConsoleGameEngine). It is in no way a good practice, but it's much easier to use for small projects than a static library.
